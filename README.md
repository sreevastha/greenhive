# 🌿 GreenHive: Sustainable Food Delivery Platform 🌿

## 🎯 Objective
- This project is a sustainable food delivery platform that connects urban consumers with fresh, locally sourced organic produce and personalized, health-based meal subscriptions.
- The platform allows consumers to order fresh vegetables, leafy greens, and millets directly from farmers and subscribe to nutritious, health-focused meal plans.
- The platform empowers local farmers by providing a direct marketplace to sell their produce, ensuring fair pricing and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
- It also includes dashboards for administrators and farmers to manage products, orders, and subscriptions efficiently.

## 🚀 How the Platform Works

### 1. 👥 User Registration and Login
- Consumers and farmers can register separately.
- Admins review and approve farmer registrations before they can start listing products.

### 2. 🥗 Fresh Produce Ordering
- Consumers browse the catalog of available products, add items to their cart, and place orders.
- Farmers fulfill orders by updating order statuses on their dashboard.

### 3. 📅 Meal Subscription Plans
- Consumers subscribe to meal plans based on their preferences or health requirements.
- Admins manage meal plans and ensure timely updates.

### 4. 🛠️ Admin Oversight
- Admins oversee platform operations, including product approvals, user management, and monitoring orders.
